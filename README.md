Introducing My LEGO Dashboard! 🏗️

I built this dynamic Power BI dashboard to explore LEGO sets with interactive filtering. It provides key KPIs like: ✅ Total sets available ✅ Average pieces per set ✅ Price distribution

With a slider-based price filter, users can easily navigate through different LEGO collections based on budget preferences. This dashboard helps enthusiasts analyze themes, age groups, and set details effortlessly!
